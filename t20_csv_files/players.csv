Najmul Hossain Shanto,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Nazmul Hossain Shanto emerged from an unusual source in Bangladesh cricket - the schools. A double-century in a school one-day match in Rajshahi grabbed the attention of age-group scouts, who quickly drafted the left-hander into Bangladesh's Under-17s. Soon, he graduated to the Under-19s in 2013, and went on to play two World Cups at that level, in 2014 and 2016."
Soumya Sarkar,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Middle order Batter,"A rarity among Bangladesh allrounders, top-order batter Soumya Sarkar bowls medium pace rather than spin, and occasionally even takes the new ball. "
Litton Das,Bangladesh,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,Liton Das is the first wicketkeeper-batsman in Bangladesh considered good enough to be a long-term successor to Mushfiqur Rahim. His domestic exploits for Abahani in the Dhaka Premier League and Rangpur Division in the National Cricket League in the 2014-15 season earned him recognition and later a call-up in the senior side for the Test against India in Fatullah in June 2015.
Shakib Al Hasan(c),Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"When the annals of Bangladesh cricket are sifted by future generations, Shakib Al Hasan will emerge and re-emerge as the greatest cricketer of its first two decades. As a bowler, Shakib is accurate, consistent and canny; aggression and a wide range of strokes are the keys to his batting. Even more importantly, he has self-belief and an excellent temperament, unflustered by the big occasion and ready to do battle against the top teams."
Afif Hossain,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Bangladesh left-hander Afif Hossain made his T20I debut in 2017 and impressed right away in his second game with a 26-ball 52 at No. 8 in a narrow win over Zimbabwe. He took a while to get going after that, although his T20I captain Mahmudullah praised his maturity during a tricky innings on a turning Mirpur pitch. In February 2022 in Chattogram, 22-year-old Afif rescued Bangladesh from 45 for 6 in a record stand with Mehidy Hasan Miraz against Afghanistan - they added an unbeaten 174, the second-highest partnership for the seventh wicket or lower in ODIs. Afif is also the youngest T20 debutant to take a five-for - he was 17 years and 72 days when he picked up 5 for 21, including the wicket of Chris Gayle, for Rajshahi Kings against Chittagong Vikings in December 2016."
Mosaddek Hossain,Bangladesh,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Mosaddek Hossain, who comes from a family of cricketers, snuck up on Bangladesh cricket's consciousness during the 2013 Dhaka Premier Division Cricket League, helping Abahani Limited stay afloat in a disastrous campaign. He struck a century and three fifties, before having to head to the Bangladesh Under-19 training camp ahead of the 2014 World Cup in the UAE. The opportunity to get out of age-group cricket quite early proved to be an important milestone in his development. "
Nurul Hasan,Bangladesh,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Nurul Hasan, who made his first-class debut in 2011, is one of a whole host of talented Bangladesh wicketkeepers who had to wait his turn to play international cricket. It wasn't entirely his fault though. For 30 years, the position behind the stumps was the domain of Khaled Mashud or Mushfiqur Rahim. "

Craig Ervine(c),Zimbabwe,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Few people in Zimbabwe cricket circles were surprised when Craig Ervine found his way into Zimbabwe colours. A stylish left-handed middle-order batsman, Ervine hails from a family with a strong cricketing tradition - his father and uncle both played first-class cricket, albeit briefly, in the late 1970s, his older brother Sean had a promising fledgling international career with Zimbabwe before heading to England to become a reliable cog in Hampshire's middle order, and even younger brother Ryan has turned out for the Southern Rocks franchise on occasion."
Milton Shumba,Zimbabwe,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Top order Batter,
Sean Williams,Zimbabwe,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Middle order Batter,"Sean Williams is a bold, dynamic left-hand batsman, and one of the most striking features about his batting is his proficiency at the reverse-sweep. That shot has occupied a proud position in the repertoire of some of Zimbabwe's finest batsmen: legend has it that Dave Houghton brought up both his hundred and his double with reverse-sweeps in the course of his 266 against Sri Lanka, and Andy Flower used the stroke in an almost profligate manner in many of his memorable innings. Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016. Equally astounding was his resolve to overcome sickness and high fever to battle on for over three hours during the course of that knock, in a game in which Zimbabwe were floundering."
Sikandar Raza,Zimbabwe,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316632.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"Sikandar Raza's story isn't that of your everyday international cricketer. He is not a teenage prodigy, nor is he someone who had a burning ambition to play for his country. He journeyed through from his adolescence to adulthood and stumbled upon the sport he sometimes played as a child, only to discover he is quite good at it."
Regis Chakabva,Zimbabwe,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A doughty wicketkeeper-batsman, Regis Chakabva's path in cricket took him through Highfields, Churchill, on to Takashinga, provincial cricket and eventually regular appearances in Zimbabwe's Twenty20, ODI and Test teams. At each level, Chakabva has improved his game and he is maturing into a fine batsman and tidy wicketkeeper."
Ryan Burl,Zimbabwe,,Left hand Bat,Legbreak,Middle order Batter,"Ryan Burl liked playing squash when he was at school, but his love of cricket - specifically, the team game's camaraderie - made him want to be an international cricketer. A left-hand lower-middle-order batter and occasional legspinner, Burl broke into the Zimbabwe side in 2017, and has also played in the BPL and Afghanistan's Shpageeza Cricket League."

But at the other end of that action there have been wickets - and lots of them. A tall, wiry fast bowler with appreciable pace and the ability to move the ball away from the right hander, Chatara has risen quickly to prominence since his first-class debut for Mountaineers in 2009. Naturally athletic, he had represented his home province of Manicaland in 200 and 400 metre events while in high school and soon found his calling in cricket."
Taskin Ahmed,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Even before he was anywhere near making his international debut, Taskin Ahmed became an internet sensation. A video of his spell against England Under-19s in 2012 found its way to Youtube, and the sight of a Bangladeshi fast bowler ripping it past batsman and hitting the wicketkeeper's gloves quite hard and high made people curious."
Hasan Mahmud,Bangladesh,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"Hasan Mahmud is one among a group of young pace bowlers who have given hope of a fast bowling uprising in Bangladesh, after decades of reliance on spin. Mahmud is still at a very early stage of his career, having just played a single T20I for Bangladesh, and earned a maiden call-up in the ODI side in January 2021, but already he has earned plenty of praise from Bangladesh's coaches for his ability to bowl fast, full and accurately.

Nasum Ahmed,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Mohammad Rizwan,Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"For several years, it appeared Mohammad Rizwan's international career would only happen in a parallel universe, racking up domestic runs even as he struggled to get a game in the national side. But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently. Most often, he was used as a stick to threaten current first-choice Pakistan wicketkeeper and captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, but the Peshawar native had qualities of his own that suggested he might have been unfortunate not to play for Pakistan more often. "
Babar Azam(c),Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batter,"A right-hand, top-order batsman known for his discipline and level-headed attitude, Babar Azam laid claim to a long-term spot in Pakistan's batting line-up with a strong performance in 2016, making three consecutive ODI hundreds against West Indies in the UAE, and a 90 in his third Test, in Hamilton. He was 22 years old at the time."
Mohammad Nawaz,Pakistan,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"Mohammad Nawaz started out in cricket at the age of 14 as a left-arm medium-fast bowler and a middle-order batsman. An all-round performance of 60 runs and a four-for for Rawalpindi against Sialkot in an inter-region Under-16 tournament in 2008 earned him a place in the Pakistan side for the International Under-15 Championship in the West Indies. On the slow pitches of the Caribbean, he changed his bowling style to left-arm spin and transformed into a spin-bowling allrounder, with help from  coach Ameer Akbar and team manager Haroon Rashid. "
Mohammad Haris,Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,
Shan Masood,Pakistan,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,"A solid and technically sound left-hand opener, Shan Masood made it to the international side after impressing consistently at junior-level cricket.

His ability to take wickets while maintaining an excellent economy rate saw him talked up as that most frequent of phenomena: an exciting Pakistani prospect. Shadab is not afraid of bowling the wrong'un either; his only criticism might be that he bowls it a bit too often, but that hasn't helped batsmen pick it up any better, either out of the hand or off the pitch. He's also a useful lower-order right-handed batsman, something that has occasionally been witnessed during his domestic career."
Shaheen Shah Afridi,Pakistan,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322200/322250.png",Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"A baby face perched on a two-metre body, Shaheen Afridi's story is trademark Pakistani. An 18-year old already comfortable in the green shirt of the national side, he's been on the radar of the national selectors for almost three years. In a more intimate circle, he was destined for great achievements well before his teenage years, with an international cricketer for an elder brother."

With a natural, whippy action that generated easy pace, he immediately stood out even in that most competitive of fields - Pakistani fast bowling. A year later, he was making his Pakistan debut in Brisbane, though not before adversity touched him; he would lose his mother just before he received his first Pakistan cap. "

Ebadot Hossain,Bangladesh,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Ebadat Hossain Chowdhury's journey from being a volleyball player for Bangladesh Air Force to becoming a Test cricketer in February 2019 was a short, and interesting, one. Living in their barracks, Ebadat dreamt of bowling like Brett Lee one day. His dream came true when he took part in the 2016 Robi Pacer Hunt in Faridpur, crisscrossing 342km southwest from his hometown Sylhet. He was one of the top three bowlers, and was duly picked by the scouts to a training camp in Dhaka."
Rahmanullah Gurbaz,Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,
Usman Ghani,Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,,Opening Batter,"One of the most exciting new talents to emerge from Afghanistan's cricket programmes in recent years, intrepid opening batsman Usman Ghani was good enough to play one-day international cricket for Afghanistan well before his 18th birthday. Ghani was also good enough to race to a century in his fourth ODI, against Zimbabwe, still aged 17. He started 2014 as part of the Afghanistan Under-19 team that defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in the Under-19 World Cup, and ended it as a member of the squad for Afghanistan's first full World Cup campaign. He warmed up for the tournament with a match-winning hundred against an Auckland team that included Kyle Mills and Mitchell McClenaghan.Liam Brickhill"
Ibrahim Zadran,Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Opening Batter,
Najibullah Zadran,Afghanistan,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Najibullah Zadran packs a punch with his bellicose left-hand batting, despite his slight frame. He has followed the same tried and tested route to the national side as many of his generation that came after the initial Afghan cricketing pioneers, with age-group cricket preparing him for the big stage. His ODI debut, against Ireland in Dublin in 2012, was possibly a little premature but Zadran's batting turned a corner in 2014 and he started to look more at home. In July, his second-innings 99 helped Afghanistan beat a strong Zimbabwe A side in an unofficial Test, and in November his unbeaten 32-ball 60 helped set up a 54-run win over Pakistan A in a Twenty match. He started 2015 well with a maiden ODI fifty, a boundary-laden 83 against Ireland, and cruised into Afghanistan's World Cup squad.Liam Brickhill"
Gulbadin Naib,Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Gulbadin Naib's first love in the sporting world was amateur bodybuilding, not cricket. When he eventually did take the game up, however, he progressed quickly through Afghanistan's age group sides as a batting allrounder and was the youngest member of the team that won the Division Five tournament in 2008 - the first stepping stone to the full world stage."
Mohammad Nabi(c),Afghanistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"Mohammad Nabi hails from a well-to-do family that moved to Peshawar in Pakistan, seeking a safe haven from the Soviet War in Afghanistan. An efficient allrounder - a strong middle-order batsman who can bowl flighted offspin - Nabi's rise, like Afghanistan's, has been staggering. He has been at the centre of the side since their time in the ICC's World Cricket League Division Five, from where Afghanistan began their rise to the international stage."

He had played only 16 first-class innings before he made his Test debut at the age of 20, and had hit only one first-class hundred before he made a maiden Test ton. That hundred - the 176 against Australia at Pallekele - was a match-flipping, series-defining knock, which given the fact no other batsman mustered more than 55 in the game, is one of the greatest ever Sri Lankan innings. Since then, Mendis has put together some impressive ODI innings as well, and has embedded himself in the Test top four. "
Dhananjaya de Silva,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"A technically correct top-order batsman from the southern reaches of the island, Dhananjaya de Silva briefly caught the national selectors' eye in 2015, then went on to have a bumper domestic season that marked him out for more intensive national duty. De Silva had been picked on potential in Sri Lanka's mid-year T20s against Pakistan, in 2015, but didn't quite convince he was a T20 batsman, hitting 45 off 47 balls across two innings. What followed, though, was an emphatic blooming."

He had an excellent tour of Australia with the U-19 team in 2009, smashing 154 off 111 balls in a one-dayer and ended the series as the leading run-getter.

Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier."
Kasun Rajitha,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Virtually unheard of before 2015, the first inkling of right-arm seamer Kasun Rajitha's potential came during a three-dayer against the touring Indians in August of that year.

Mark Adair,Ireland,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowling Allrounder,"Mark Adair is a tall, seam-bowling allrounder from Northern Ireland who made his first-class debut for Warwickshire while still a teenager at the end of the 2015 season. From a sporting family - his father was a goalkeeper at a decent level and his brother plays rugby and represented Ireland at cricket at age-group level - Adair also showed promise in rugby but committed to cricket having been offered a trial by Warwickshire in 2013. He has represented Ireland at age-group and A team level and claimed the wicket of Marcus Trescothick as his maiden victim in first-class cricket. He was released by Warwickshire at the end of the 2017 season and has since played for Northern Knights and Durham's second team.

Durham did just that and McCarthy made his first-class debut in 2015. A maiden five-wicket haul for Durham against Lancashire in Chester-le-Street the following year added to the good impression he had built at Ireland Under-19 level and during a spell with the Australian grade side Randwick-Petersham.

Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai.

He sat out the 2019 World Cup after it emerged he had served a ban for a second drugs test failure for a recreational substance, which seemed to lead the England management and the team's senior players to decide that Hales' behaviour had caused a breakdown of trust between the parties. He was also overlooked for the 2021 T20 World Cup."

Liam Livingstone,England,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Batting Allrounder,"The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the ""belligerent face of England's next generation"" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine."
Chris Woakes,England,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Allrounder,"By the time Chris Woakes returned from England's tour to South Africa at the start of 2016, he feared his Test career was over. He was 27 by then and had played six Tests. But, despite bowling respectably on almost every outing, he had never quite made the breakthrough and an average of 63.75 made dispiriting reading.

One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India.

Leask also bowls useful off-spin, taking three wickets in Scotland's win over Tasmania in their World Cup acclimatisation tour in autumn 2014.
Leask played a solitary first-class game for Northants in a tour match against New Zealand A in 2014. He moved on to Somerset ahead of the 2016 season with Somerset's director of cricket Matt Maynard describing him as a ""feisty cricketer"".

He had made his international debut against India in a T20I in February of that year."
James Neesham,New Zealand,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Batting Allrounder,"Allrounder, and Twitter star, Jimmy Neesham went from the brink of retirement from cricket to almost delivering New Zealand the 2019 World Cup. In the tournament he was outstanding with bat and ball then in the final against England claimed three wickets and produced the final-ball run out to tie the scores after 50 overs. He was entrusted with the bat in the Super Over and scored 13 off 5 balls including a huge six off Jofra Archer. He was at the non-striker's end for the last ball when Martin Guptill was run out coming back for a second run that would have won New Zealand the World Cup. "
Trent Boult,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Rated as one half of the best new-ball pair in New Zealand history by Sir Richard Hadlee, Trent Boult is a left-arm quick who presents a significant threat to batsmen around the world with an ability to move the ball both ways even in unresponsive conditions."
Tim Southee,New Zealand,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316596.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowler,"Tim Southee, a right-arm swing bowler, burst upon the international scene in great style. He was still only 19, with only one T20I cap behind him, and fresh from a Player-of-the-Tournament performance at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup when he was handed a Test debut against England in Napier. Southee responded with 5 for 55 before smashing 77 off 40 balls in the second innings with nine sixes."
Lockie Ferguson,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A right-arm quick with a good bouncer, it is Lockie Ferguson's speed that made a breakout star at the 2019 World Cup in England. Regularly hitting 150kph, Ferguson's raw speed bowling first change yielded 21 wickets at just 19.47 and an economy rate of 4.88. He finished second on the tournament wicket tally behind Mitchell Starc. He was rewarded with being named in the ICC's team of the tournament alongside skipper Kane Williamson. "
Mitchell Santner,New Zealand,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319792.png",Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"A left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner, Mitchell Santner was first elevated to the New Zealand side after a promising 2014-15 domestic season. "
Ish Sodhi,New Zealand,,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler,"There is little in Ish Sodhi's statistics to suggest he is an international-quality legspinner, but New Zealand's selectors have seen enough in his aggressive approach and keen attitude to hand him a Test debut after only one full season of first-class cricket. Known chiefly for the turn he generates and the flight he fearlessly trusts, Sodhi's journey to top-level cricket has been a triumph of determination over significant odds."
Luke Jongwe,Zimbabwe,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,
Haider Ali,Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,,Middle order Batter,
Asif Ali,Pakistan,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Where was Asif Ali in the years Pakistan had been crying out for a power hitter? It took the exposure of the PSL for Asif Ali to come to prominence in an Islamabad United side that owed much to him for their title-winning campaign in 2018. A six in a Super Over against Mustafizur Rahman got their campaign up and running, and it wasn't until he smashed three sixes in arrow in a nerve-wracking chase that his side were assured victory. "

hand Bat,,Opening Batter,"A tall, elegant right-hand batsman who can keep wicket in a crisis, KL Rahul is among the most highly rated opening batsmen in India's next generation. Rahul was a part of India's squad in the 2010 Under-19 World Cup and made his first-class debut later that year. Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final."

hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Top order Batter,"Languid and easy on the eye, Rohit Sharma owned all the shots in the book when he emerged from the Mumbai suburbs as heir apparent to the Indian batting greats of the 2000s. It took him time and persistence, but by the 2010s he had become a colossus in white-ball cricket, and the man in charge of perhaps the most formidable league team in the first age of T20."
Virat Kohli,India,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316605.png",Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runs. Plenty of them."
Suryakumar Yadav,India,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_640,q_50/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/331100/331163.png",Right hand Bat,"Right arm Medium, Right arm Offbreak",Batter,"Hard-hitting 360-degree batter Suryakumar Yadav has all the shots, including a few not in any textbook save the one written by AB de Villiers. he also has a yen for making batting look easy, as he showed during four golden years with Mumbai Indians starting in 2018, during which they won the IPL title twice, thanks in no small part to his 1700-plus runs at a strike rate of around 140."
Axar Patel,India,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowling Allrounder,"Left-arm spinner Axar Patel has been increasingly handy with the bat in the lower order across formats - enough to be classified as a bowling allrounder. He played just one first-class game in his debut season for Gujarat, but had a more successful showing in 2013, when he was one of the key contributors to India Under-23s' title win in the ACC Emerging Teams Cup, with seven wickets, including a four-for in the semi-final against UAE. He was consistent for Gujarat with bat and ball in the Ranji Trophy that season, finishing with 369 runs at an average of 46.12 and 29 wickets at 23.58."
Hardik Pandya,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Allrounder,"Hardik Pandya swears by living life king size and that exuberance finds expression in his powerful hitting in the middle order and brisk seam bowling. He first caught the eye with an unbeaten 31-ball 61 for Mumbai Indians against Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2015, but displayed greater consistency in the Syed Mushtaq Ali domestic T20 tournament in January 2016. He finished as the leading run-getter, for Baroda, with 377 runs in 10 innings at an average of 53.85. "
Dinesh Karthik,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Not many would forget the sight of Dinesh Karthik in India colours, horizontal on the ground, as he stumped Michael Vaughan in 2004. It was his first dismissal as a wicketkeeper for India, but his international career never really took off. Around the time he began churning out consistent runs in domestic cricket, India had MS Dhoni at the helm and behind the stumps, so there was very little Karthik could do. A man who was an integral part of a Test series victory over England in 2007, who showed he could open the batting in spicy conditions, just could not capitalise on his second chances. "
Ravichandran Ashwin,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Bowling Allrounder,"R Ashwin took the tricks and skills he learned playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets of Chennai, particularly the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak, to Test cricket, where he became perhaps the leading offspinner of the first quarter of the 21st century."
Bhuvneshwar Kumar,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Bowler,"At the time of his India debut in 2012, Bhuvneshwar Kumar seemed the answer to the side's fast-bowling scarcity; though middling in pace, he produced swing both ways and had a devastating inswinger. In his first T20I over, he bowled Nasir Jamshed; with his first ODI delivery, he bowled Mohammad Hafeez; and in his first Test series he played a part in India's first whitewash win in a four-Test series, against Australia in 2013. "
Arshdeep Singh,India,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,
Mohammed Shami,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Mohammed Shami was India's leading fast bowler in the 2015 World Cup in Australia, when the team marched into the semi-finals and picked up 77 out of 80 wickets on offer. It was later revealed that he had played through that entire tournament - and the preceding Test series against the hosts, essentially four months - through a knee injury. His success can be attributed to his pace, accuracy and primarily his skill in moving the ball - both old and new. "
Shariz Ahmad,Netherlands,,Left hand Bat,Legbreak Googly,Bowler,
Johnson Charles,West Indies,,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A muscular opener with a penchant for swatting the ball square either side of the wicket, much like Dwayne Smith, Johnson Charles was part of West Indies' T20 World Cup winning teams in 2012 and 2016. While Smith's second skill is seam bowling, Charles' is wicketkeeping. With Denesh Ramdin representing West Indies in all three formats, and Andre Fletcher also in the limited-overs mix, West Indies have used Charles' second skill sparingly."
Dushmantha Chameera,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"Tall, slim and slippery, Dushmantha Chameera arrived at NCC in 2012, and was quickly marked out as a bowler for the future. First among his virtues is pace, generated from a slightly round-arm action that sacrifices movement. Capable of consistently hitting speeds of over 140 kph, coaches believe he had become the quickest bowler in the country by 23. He had played only a handful of games in his first two seasons, but came into his own in NCC's 2013-14 championship run, claiming 32 first-class cricket at 21.18."
Aryan Lakra,U.A.E.,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Dasun Shanaka,Sri Lanka,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Allrounder,"An explosive middle-order batsman, and steady right-arm seam bowler, Dasun Shanaka worked his way into Sri Lanka's T20 side through several seasons of good performances for Sinhalese Sports Club. Born and educated in Negombo, Shanaka made his T20 international debut against Pakistan in August 2015, but it wasn't until the following domestic season that he achieved wide acclaim. Batting at No. 4 in an AIA Premier T20 match against Saracens Sports Club, Shanaka struck a Sri Lankan record 16 sixes in an innings worth 123 from 46 balls. That wasn't even his biggest T20 score of the last week. He had hit 131 off 48 balls against Galle Cricket Club one week earlier."
Rishabh Pant,India,,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A match-turning, swashbuckling batter-keeper in the Adam Gilchrist mould, Rishabh Pant has had a starring role in more than a handful of India's biggest Test matches in his first few years in the team."
Chris Jordan,England,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Chris Jordan, a fast bowler with a level-headed calmness and a fearsome yorker, found his niche as a death specialist in T20 cricket for England after initially breaking through as a bowling allrounder in Tests and ODIs. "
Deepak Hooda,India,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"An allrounder who can bat in any position, Deepak Hooda also bowls offbreaks, offers plenty of athleticism as a boundary fielder, and is an asset in any T20 side. His big hitting as a 19-year-old in his debut IPL season, in 2015, earned with the nickname ""Hurricane Hooda"", but more importantly, got him a Rs 4.2 crore (US$ 622,000 approx) contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad at the next auction. "
Lungi Ngidi,South Africa,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"A tall, imposing paceman, Lungi Ngidi can reach speeds in the 140s kph and is as comfortable opening the bowling as he is at the death, making him one of South Africa's most promising prospects. Ngidi was schooled at Kwa-Zulu Natal's Hilton College and was involved at every provincial age-group level from Under-13 upwards. "
Aaron Finch(c),Australia,,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Top order Batter,"A solidly built, aggressive batter from a country town in Victoria, Aaron Finch ascended to become Australia's ODI and T20I captain, leading his country to their first T20 World Cup triumph in 2021. "
Tim David,Australia,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Middle order Batter,"Mumbai Indians' decision to sign Tim David for INR 8.25 crore (AUD 1.5 million) at the 2022 IPL auction confirmed two things. Firstly, that the game's formats had diverged so much that a man without a state contract or even a first-class appearance to his name could be worth such a sum; and secondly, that David had become one of the world's most sought-after T20 finishers over the previous 12 months."
Matthew Wade,Australia,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Wicketkeeper Batter,It has been a career of reinvention for Matthew Wade as he went from Test wicketkeeper to specialist middle-order batsman to T20I World Cup winning wicketkeeper/finisher via a prolific run in domestic cricket when it appeared his international days were over.
Mitchell Starc,Australia,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"First there was Johnson, then there was Starc. A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."
Tony Munyonga,Zimbabwe,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,
Wellington Masakadza,Zimbabwe,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,
Danushka Gunathilaka,Sri Lanka,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Allrounder,"A poised, attacking left-handed opener groomed in part at Sinhalese Sports Club, Danushka Gunathilaka was plucked from the domestic system largely on potential, and drafted into Sri Lanka's A team for the tour of New Zealand in mid-2015. He impressed on that trip, hitting two smart fifties from four innings, to finish as the team's second-highest run-scorer."
Stephan Myburgh,Netherlands,,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Opening Batter,
Brandon Glover,Netherlands,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast,Bowler,"A Dutch-South African fast bowler, Brandon Glover left South Africa after a call from Netherlands coach Ryan Campbell, who convinced him to put his Dutch passport to good use after he had finished his accounting degree. He had played Under-19 cricket for South Africa, but was enticed by the opportunity to play regular international cricket, and starred at the T20 World Cup Qualifier in late 2019, bowling hard lengths into the pitch at high pace."
Fakhar Zaman,Pakistan,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,"Born in Mardan, where the standard of batsmanship will always be measured by arguably Pakistan's greatest Test batsman Younis Khan, Fakhar Zaman has been on Pakistan's thankless domestic circuit for over five years with almost no attention. A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt."

Zane Green,Namibia,,Left hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,
Ruben Trumpelmann,Namibia,,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,
Ahmed Raza,U.A.E.,,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Six-foot-five Ahmed Raza is best known for his economical spells of left-arm spin. In a must-win World Cricket Division Two game for UAE against Oman in 2018, he conceded only 16 runs in nine overs for two wickets, and in an Asia Cup match against Oman in 2016, he took 1 for 6 from three overs. "
Regis Chakabva(c),Zimbabwe,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A doughty wicketkeeper-batsman, Regis Chakabva's path in cricket took him through Highfields, Churchill, on to Takashinga, provincial cricket and eventually regular appearances in Zimbabwe's Twenty20, ODI and Test teams. At each level, Chakabva has improved his game and he is maturing into a fine batsman and tidy wicketkeeper."
Hazratullah Zazai,Afghanistan,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Opening Batter,Afghanistan's ascent up the global rankings from ICC Associate nation to Full Member and Test status has been largely propelled by a conveyor belt of fast bowling and mystery spin. But the country has struggled to unearth quality batting prospects at the same rate as their bowling unit. The emergence of the hard-hitting Hazratullah Zazai is a sign that this may change early in the country's Full Member era.
Shoriful Islam,Bangladesh,,Left hand Bat,Left arm Medium fast,Bowler,"At 6ft three inches, Shoriful Islam became a left-arm pace sensation almost overnight, when he starred in Bangladesh's 2020 Under-19 World Cup triumph. He took nine wickets, but it was his aggression and pace in the knockout games against South Africa, New Zealand and (in the final against) India that stood out."
Phil Salt,England,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"Phil Salt's fearless ball-striking at the top of the Sussex order earned him attention from across the global T20 circuit and a maiden England call-up in 2019, though he was made to wait until 2021 for his debut when he performed a passable impression of Jason Roy in the Covid-hit ODI series against Pakistan."
Ashton Agar,Australia,,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"Ashton Agar initially turned almost as many heads as he has turned cricket balls. At the age of 19 he had a place in the squads of Western Australia, Perth Scorchers, and the national team, having sensationally been upgraded from an internship on the 2013 tour of India to a more expansive role in Michael Clarke's squad. "
Heinrich Klaasen,South Africa,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"A clean-hitting, wicketkeeper batsman, Heinrich Klaasen emerged on the scene at the same time that Quinton de Kock nailed down a place in the South African team, across all formats. As someone who had always combined the disciplines of batting and glovework, Klaasen hoped to make it in either skill and establish himself as all-round option, if required."
Timm van der Gugten,Netherlands,,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"Timm van der Gugten, born in Sydney, made his first-class debut for New South Wales in November 2011. He was called up to the Netherlands the following year for World Twenty20 in the West Indies and made his debut at 21. He also represented the Netherlands at two subsequent World Twenty20s where he has carried one of their most potent threats. "
