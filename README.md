*Abstract*--- The findings of this report are based on the data analysis
of T20 World Cup through statistical methods and data visualization.
Cricketing performance indicators include batting and bowling, match
result, and players' statistics. A large amount of data from CSV and
JSON files has been preprocessed, transformed and visualized to identify
patterns and trends of the T20 World Cup. The goal of the report is to
deliver useful data for fans, analysts, and decision-makers to
comprehend the tendencies of the tournament.

Keywords---Cricket, Python, PowerBI, Data Analysis.

1\) Introduction

The T20 World Cup is one of the thrilling cricket tournaments and people
from across the globe are fond of it \[1\]. Therefore, the main
objectives of this report are to evaluate the performance of players and
teams, as well as to explain the results of the tournament based on data
analysis and visualization. In this analysis, Python, Pandas and Power
BI will be used to explore multiple facets of the tournament such as the
best performing teams, comparisons of teams and the outcomes of the
matches.

2\) Methodology

The analysis on the T20 player selection information has been conducted
using various techniques and methods such as below:

2.1) Data Availability

Data availability refers to the process of ensuring that the required
data for analysis is readily available and accurate. The following data
was collected from the ESPN \[2\] in JSON format for T20 International
Men\'s cricket in the year 2023:

-   Batting summary :This file contains the data of the batsmen who
    performed in the matches.

-   Bowling summary : This file contains the data of the bowling who
    performed in the matches.

-   Match results : This file contains the data of the matches
    mentioning about win/loss.

-   Player information : This file contains the statistics of the player
    with batting scores, bowling figures, etc.

2.2) Data Validation

Prior to the data validation, the JSON raw data was transformed into
human-readable tabular formats, such as dataframes. Data validation was
carried out on all four dataframes using a common key attribute  for
joining, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the data intended for
later visualisation\[3\]. The following data validations were performed
on the source records:

1.  Data Deduplication:

> In the next phase, we systematically investigated for the expected
> duplicate records that could possibly arise in the dataset for the
> columns identified. After identifying any duplicates, each duplicate
> record was eliminated to ensure that only unique entries remained for
> further processing and analysis

2.  Data Cleansing:

> In our study, we examined of all null values in records that are
> considered as essential key attribute columns.  To avoid any potential
> errors,  null records were checked thoroughly and removed. Only
> records that has been successfully passed the initial validation were
> passed onto the next phase of verification and analysis, confirming
> the  authenticity of the data used for our research.

3.  Character Set Standardization :

> During our data analysis, we discovered that several utf8 characters
> associated with the data that affecting its dependability. To overcome
> this issue, we efficiently search and removed erroneous utf8
> characters and process only records with valid character sets and
> symbols for further analysis.

4.  Data Indexing :

> The source files were split into multiple datasets. To ensure precise
> record matching across all four files, we added a new attribute called
> match_id. This identifier helps to accurately join based on matching
> criteria, ensuring that outcomes are derived from unified data sets
> rather than random combinations. This approach improves reliability of
> the data and clearly distinguishes related records from any potential
> mismatches.

2.3) Data Readiness

Following wide data wrangling methods to ensure correctness and
consistency, we added additional essential attributes that are required
as part of our analysis. This process involves inspecting the dataset to
eliminate inconsistencies and discrepancies.

Once the data passed our quality criteria, we formatted it into CSV for
seamless integration with Power BI, a powerful

tool for visualizing and interpreting data. This step allows us to
create insightful visual representations that help us to find
correlations in the dataset.

By preparing the data in this structured format, we improve its
usefulness across several platforms, allowing to prepare more meaningful
opinions in our research. This approach not only prevents the integrity
of our findings, but also boosts the utility of the data in making
informed decisions and drawing reliable conclusions.

2.4) Data Exploration Criterion

To build an effective T20 cricket squad of 11 players with a balanced
range of abilities, it is important to avoid selecting only batsmen.
Instead, the team should comprise a mix of openers, middle-order
batsmen, finishers, all-rounders, and specialist bowlers to ensure a
well-rounded squad. The selection process is based on a set of criteria
that evaluates player 2023 performance, helping the management to make
informed recommendations.

This data-driven strategy ensures that only the best candidates are
shortlisted. The selected data is then forwarded to the management team
and the team captains, who will determine each player\'s suitability for
the final selection. The goal is to put together a team that can score
and defend the essential runs, increasing the chances of winning in the
game. The management\'s decisions play a significant role in
constructing a squad that is both balanced and well-suited to excel in
all aspects of the game.

3.) Results

This section presents the findings derived from the analysis of various
metrics and analysis during the study.

3.1) Displaying Player profile Data

Based on our parameters, we get a shortlist of all the players who match
the criteria for openers. One of it as we see is Alex Hales and when
hovered over his profile we see a small description of the player, his
picture and his stats in all the matches.

3.2) Selection of players based on criteria

This is the main page of our report which contains the tabs Power
Hitters, Anchors, Finishers, All-Rounders, Specialist Fast Bowlers. Each
of these roles have specific criteria.  The criteria for the different
roles are:

1.  Openers/Power Hitters: Average\>30, Strike Rate\>140, Innings
    Batted\>3, Boundary % \>50, Batting Position\<4.

2.  Anchors/Middle Order: Average\>40, Strike Rate\>125, Innings
    Batted\>3, Average Balls Faced\> 20, Batting Position\>2.

3.  Finishers: Average\>20, Strike Rate\>130, Innings Batted\>3,
    Boundary % \>60, Batting Position\>4, Average Balls Faced\> 12,
    Innings Bowled\>1.

4.  All-Rounders:  Average\>15, Strike Rate\>140, Innings Batted\>2,
    Boundary % \>70, Batting Position\>4, Average Balls Faced\> 12,
    Innings Bowled\>2, Bowling Economy\<7, Bowling Strike Rate \<20

5.  Specialist Fast Bowlers: Innings Bowled\>4, Bowling Economy\<7,
    Bowling Strike Rate \<16, Bowling Style="%Fast %", Bowling
    Average\<20, Dot Ball Percentage\>40.

These criteria have been met using filters as seen in the picture. When
a tab is chosen, we get the best players for those filters. When a
player is selected, we see area graphs for each measured value. We also
have a plot graph where X-axis represents the Batting Average and Y-axis
represents the Stike Rate and all the top players can be seen on the
graph. A lay man could just see who's on top in the graph and select
him.

3.3) Choosing the best 11 players around

The players that are available for the

1.  Opener/Power hitters

2.  Middle order

3.  Finisher/Lower order

4.  Lower middle order/All-rounders

5.  Fast bowlers/Tail end

categories will be listed according to the requirements outlined in the
player selection criteria as in (B). From this list, we will choose two
players for the opener category, two players for middle order, two
players for finisher, three players for middle order/all-rounders, and
the final two players for the fast bowler's category. This means that we
will have our top 11 players who will be able to both score and defend
150 runs on average, for an average of 180 runs.

4\) Conclusion

Based on the results, it is concluded that the management and team
captains can select a combination of 11 players who can either score 180
runs or successfully defend a total of 150 runs.
